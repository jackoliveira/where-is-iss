# Where is ISS

This project uses Angular, a simple [api](http://api.open-notify.org) that gives the current Latitude and Longitude of the ISS, [LeafletJS](https://leafletjs.com/) which provides a series of tools to navigate through the map and put the ISS icon on the right place, [mapbox.com](https://www.mapbox.com/) and [OpenStreetMap](https://www.openstreetmap.org/) that provide these clean, confident and perfect maps ~~_and for last my creativity which made all this together work._~~

## Running this project

- Be sure that `Node`, `Angular` and `@angular/CLI` is installed.

- Generate an APIKey at [mapbox.com](https://www.mapbox.com/)

- Paste the key into your `src/environments/environment.ts` `mapBoxAPIKEY: YOUR_MAPBOX_API_KEY`

- Run `ng serve` for start a server. Navigate to [http://localhost:4200/](http://localhost:4200/).

- Be free to suggest improvements.
