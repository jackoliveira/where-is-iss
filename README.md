# Where is ISS

This project uses Angular, a simple [api](http://api.open-notify.org) that gives the current Latitude and Longitude of the ISS, [LeafletJS](https://leafletjs.com/) which provides a series of tools to navigate through the map and put the ISS icon on the right place, [OpenStreetMap](https://www.openstreetmap.org/) that provide these clean, confident and perfect maps ~~_and for last my creativity which made all this together work._~~
